  about: {
    summary: "I am an Academic and Computer Vision Researcher with a strong foundation in Feature Extraction and Pattern Recognition, currently serving as a Lecturer at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS). I graduated Cum Laude with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM).",
    vision: "My research portfolio focuses on Hybrid Feature Extraction (Color, Texture, Motion) and Deep Learning architectures, demonstrated through publications in IEEE and SPIE. I am now seeking to transition these advanced methodologies into the domain of Medical Image Analysis to develop interpretative AI models for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)."
